                    This report shows the top twenty invoice totals for insurance companies with a high total invoice for a given patient.<br>
                    Entering a threshold below will limit those patients who have paid above that amount to one insurance company for 1 or more visits. <br>
                    More interesting data sets result from limiting above 1500.<br>
